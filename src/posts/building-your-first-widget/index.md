So, I spoke at WordCamp Nashville today and I had an absolute blast! The other sessions were very informative, I especially enjoyed learning about some tools for debugging plugins and themes. My session was the last one in the developer track. You can download my boilerplate widget code using the nice, giant green button on my home page or the link below. Here are my slides, I hope you learn something new:
